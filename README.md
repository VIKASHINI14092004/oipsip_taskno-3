# oipsip_taskno-3 Predicting Car Selling Prices

# Introduction:

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the selling prices of cars based on their features. The dataset used for this analysis contains information about various car attributes such as the year of manufacture, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, selling type, and transmission.

# Data Loading and Initial Exploration:

The dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for initial exploration. This step involves examining the first few rows, summary statistics, and data types of the variables.

# Data Preprocessing:

Categorical Encoding: Categorical variables such as 'Fuel_Type', 'Selling_Type', and 'Transmission' are encoded using LabelEncoder to convert them into numerical format suitable for machine learning models.

Feature Scaling: Numerical features including 'Year', 'Present_Price', and 'Kms_Driven' are standardized using StandardScaler to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
# Splitting Data into Training and Test Sets:

The dataset is divided into training and test sets with a ratio of 80:20 using train_test_split function. This ensures that the model is trained on a subset of the data and evaluated on unseen data.

# Model Training and Evaluation:

Model Selection: RandomForestRegressor, an ensemble learning method, is chosen for its ability to handle both numerical and categorical features and its capability to capture complex relationships in the data.

Model Training: The RandomForestRegressor is trained on the training data with 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) and a random state of 42 for reproducibility.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), which measures the average squared difference between the actual and predicted selling prices on the test set.

# Conclusion:

The developed machine learning model demonstrates promising results in predicting car selling prices based on various features.

Further refinements such as feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, and exploring alternative models could potentially enhance the predictive accuracy of the model.
